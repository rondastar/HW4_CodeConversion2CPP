# HW4_CodeConversion2CPP
 First C++ project (with vector of class objects) for CSI 226 at RTC

For this project, we were instructed to use a language of our choice. Mine was C++, because it is used in some fields I am interested in, and it is more energy efficient than many other languages. I am also interested in learning about garbage collection, but I didn't get to that yet.

Originally I started this project in VS Code, but I am not very familiar with that IDE and had trouble getting the code to work. Eventually I figured out that my code was working, but the compiler wasn't set up right. I thought the JSON files might be the key, so I tinkered with them a bit but ultimately decided to switch to Visual Studio 2022, because it was highly recommended in a tutorial I referenced (learncpp.com). Once I switched to Visual Studio, things went much more smoothly.

some other details...
**Is it a higher or lower level language then C# and Java ( Which are both considered the same level )? ** Lower level

**Is it a strongly or loosely typed language? ** Strongly typed

**Is it a compiled or scripted language? ** Compiled


**What applications did you plan to build with it? ** I'm planning to start a recipe app using C++, but I haven't determined yet if it's really a good fit. But I am enjoying C++ and learning a lot from working with it, so I'll give it a try.

**List some tutorials you plan to use to help with your project. ** The main tutorial I am referencing at this point is learn.cpp. It has been very helpful!
